Given the following problem description: "{problem_description}"

1.  **Problem Analysis:**
    *   Summarize the core classification task in one sentence.
    *   Determine if this is a `binary` or `multiclass` classification problem.
    *   If `multiclass`, list the distinct class labels as an array of strings (e.g., ["spam", "ham", "promotional"]). If `binary`, use ["negative_class", "positive_class"] or more descriptive names if apparent from the problem.

2.  **Data Generation Prompts:**
    *   For *each* class label identified, create a specific, detailed prompt to generate synthetic text data representative of that class. Ensure prompts encourage diversity and realism.
    *   The prompts should be structured as a JSON object where keys are the class labels and values are the prompt strings.

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Suggest a short, snake_case `model_prefix` for file naming.
    *   Recommend a `training_data_volume` (e.g., 500, 1000, 2000) for the total dataset size (it will be split among classes).

Return *only* JSON format:

**Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Assess the quality and relevance of the generated samples for *each class* based on the Problem Description. Are they distinct? Diverse? Do they accurately represent their respective classes?
2.  **Suggest Improvements:** Provide specific, actionable suggestions on how to modify *each* prompt to generate data that is more diverse, more accurately reflects the class nuances, and might lead to a better classifier. Focus on clarity, specificity, and covering potential variations for each class.

**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class "{class_label}" for testing a {classification_type} classifier.

**All Class Labels:** {all_class_labels_str}

**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of "{class_label}" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:
*   Borderline cases that barely meet the "{class_label}" criteria.
*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle "{class_label}" signals).
*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the "{class_label}" class.
*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as "{class_label}".

Generate only the text samples, one per line. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in {language} language.

2.  **Identify Strengths:** What does the model seem to handle well for each class?
